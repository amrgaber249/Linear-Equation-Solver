# Linear-Equation-Solver

We will implement a program for solving systems of linear equations, which takes as an input the equations, the technique to use and its required parameters.

This project aims to compare and analyze the behavior of numerical methods studied in class: Gaussian-elimination, LU decomposition, Gaussian-Jordan and Gauss-Seidel.
